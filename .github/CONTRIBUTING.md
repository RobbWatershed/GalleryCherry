## Contributing to Hentoid

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/AVnetWS/Hentoid/issues/).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/AVnetWS/Hentoid/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. Follow the included template if unsure.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Templates have been provided and are set up for automatic insertion whenever a new issue has been created, simply follow the same format and replace the text where needed.

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting guidelines](https://github.com/AVnetWS/Hentoid/blob/master/.github/REPORTING_GUIDELINES.md) page.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**
