## Contributing to the Documentation

* The Hentoid Documentation is a joint effort between the programmers and the Hentoid Community.
As the application is updated, the documentation will need to reflect said changes.

* At the moment, the documentation is incomplete. A draft has been submitted in order to establish a document style for anyone that wishes to contribute to it.
This document style is not enforced, but it is highly recommended to be followed for those that don't know where to start.

* In order to update the documentation, you can make use of the editor provided by GitHub (you will need to create a free account in order to do so) or by cloning the files to your system and editing them there. The Hentoid Documentation can be accessed [here](https://github.com/AVnetWS/Hentoid/wiki).

*If you are uncomfortable working with GitHub and/or git, please submit your changes online (either a wiki or attached as a file) and link them to a discussion on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/QEZ3qk9)*
