## Reporting an Issue

* GalleryCherry uses [GitHub Issue Tracking](https://github.com/RobbWatershed/GalleryCherry/issues) to track issues (primarily bugs and contributions of new code). If you've found a bug in GalleryCherry, this is the place to start. You'll need to create a (free) GitHub account in order to submit an issue, to comment on them or to create pull requests.

* GalleryCherry also makes uses of [Templates](https://help.github.com/articles/helping-people-contribute-to-your-project/). Whenever you submit an issue, be sure to read the included document and answer any questions before reporting an issue. This will provide the required information needed to prioritize a reported issue.

* If you are unsure whether an issue should be added to the issue tracker or if you don't have all the required information to submit an issue, visit our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/waTF8vw)
